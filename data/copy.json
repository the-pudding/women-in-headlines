    "value":"173 years ago at the Seneca Falls Convention, the American suffragette movement kicked off with a declaration that “all men and women are created equal”. When newspapers covered this historic call for women's right to vote, some readers read headlines like <a href='https://senecafallscoverage.tumblr.com/post/78771341533/the-north-star-july-28th-1848' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>“The Rights of Women”</a> which echoed the messages of the event. Others read headlines like <a href='https://senecafallscoverage.tumblr.com/post/78771452513/the-mechanics-advocate' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>“Women out of their latitude”</a> which carried the woeful news of a publisher who was worried about the womanly duties that were abandoned for the sake of this convention. There were also articles without headlines, where the publisher lamented what the <a href='https://senecafallscoverage.tumblr.com/post/78771482216/oneida-whig' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>men would do about their dinners if women went out to vote.</a><br><br> Over the years, women have gained more freedom and space to express themselves while newspaper editors lost some of theirs. There were fewer title-less pieces that took the liberty to walk readers through long descriptive paragraphs. The publisher’s instinct shifted to more crisp headlines that conveyed the crux of the story. In 2006, when Sampat Pal Devi started The Gulabi Gang (the pink gang), a female vigilante group, to protest against domestic violence in one of the most conservative villages in Northern India, the news was not merely about reporting an event but about painting a picture. Across the globe, people heard of <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7068875.stm' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>India's 'pink' vigilante women</a>. Some publishers took the creative freedom to title it <a href='https://www.theage.com.au/world/pretty-in-pink-female-vigilantes-also-handy-with-an-axe-20071215-ge6if6.html' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>‘Pretty in pink, female vigilantes, also handy with an axe’</a>. Women handy with axes was as novel in 2006 as women taking the stage was in 1848.<br><br> Cultural shifts are typically much slower than leaps in technological advancement. Stories, and the words used to tell them, can be an effective way to observe the culture of a society. Somewhere between the time of black and white print newspapers and bite-sized content released on a mobile app, <a href='https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/headlines-journalism/' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>headlines started to turn news into stories</a>.<br><br> Behind these catchy headlines that are designed to stick are the often-edited-out names, nuances, and stories of women who make the headline. While the piece itself can clarify, construct and conserve the full story, in a world too busy to look past the headline they tend to have a <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/headlines-change-way-think' target='_blank' class='intextLink'>disproportionate impact on the reader’s mind</a>. If these headlines are all that some of us will read each morning, we wanted to know how the headlines about women have changed over the last decade.<br><br> Borrowing some of the spirits of the Black, feminist, lesbian author, activist and poet, Audre Lorde, who said, <i>“For those of us who write, it is necessary to scrutinize not only the truth of what we speak but the truth of that language by which we speak it,” </i> we chose to examine the words used when women made headlines.<br><br>Using keywords synonymous with “woman”, we scraped 382139 headlines from the last decade published by the top 50 English-language news publications across four countries."}],

By aggregating the polarity scores of an outlet's headlines we can rank each outlet on the basis of their average polarity."},{"type":"text","value":"For each headline we measure <strong>bias</strong> by tracking the combined occurrence of gendered language and social stereotypes usually associated with women.

Examples of words that we categorize as social stereotypes are <strong> slut </strong>, <strong>emotional</strong>, <strong>sensitive</strong>, or <strong>married</strong>, among many others. By counting these co-occurrences we are able to assign a gender bias score to each headline.
