This unbalance is reflected in the news articles that we read every day, where women are often described in ways that reinforce social stereotypes and deepen gender biases.

Bubbles represent outlets, and are sized by the size of their audience."},{"type":"text","value":"For each headline we measure <strong>polarity</strong> by using sentiment analysis, a machine learning technique that is used to detect emotional affect in text. In this analysis we chose to consider the emotional <strong>strength</strong> of each headline as a proxy for polarity (irrespective of whether the emotion is positive or negative). By aggregating the polarity scores of an outlet's headlines we can rank each outlet on the basis of their average polarity."},{"type":"text","value":"For each headline we measure <strong>bias</strong> by tracking the combined occurrence of gendered language and social stereotypes usually associated with women. Gendered language includes gendered pronouns (i.e. she, her, mrs, mis etc.) and gendered nouns (i.e. girl, spokeswoman, girlfriend etc.). Examples of words that we categorize as social stereotypes are <strong> slut </strong>, <strong>emotional</strong>, <strong>sensitive</strong>, or <strong>married</strong>, among many others. By counting these co-occurrences we are able to assign a gender bias score to each headline. For example, a recent headline by the <i>Daily Mail</i> reads:"},{"type":"text","value":"'<strong>Woman</strong> reveals <strong>she</strong>'s thinking about dumping <strong>her</strong> boyfriend because of his close <strong>female</strong> friend'"},{"type":"text","value":"This headline would get a bias score of 4.
